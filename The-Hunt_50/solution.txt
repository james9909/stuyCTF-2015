A quick search reveals that the weird code at the bottom of Daniel Zabari's Facebook page
actually refers to imgur, so you go to:

    https://imgur.com/k6Sj1Qf

But, theres this weird picture of Zabari and a snake, which looks important, but doesn't really
relate to the problem. Instead, note that the title of the picture is "document/d/edit",
and that refers to google docs. Also, the string at the bottom refers to which document to view.

Finally, there is one more puzzle, and the link refers to pastebin, so go to
