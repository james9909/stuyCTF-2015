If we look at the strings of the picture, using 'strings pic.jpg'
we find a suspicious string that seems to be base64
encoded. However, that's not the only sus thing, since there is a 'hint' as well.
The picture is of a blowfish, so we can assume that it is base64 encoded with blowfish.
If we run it through a base64 decoder with the blowfish algorithm, and 'itsapuffer'
as the key, we are given the link to a dropbox file. If we explode the gif on
the dropbox, we get a barcode, and if we scan it using an online scanner, we get the flag.
