In order to log in, we need to change the value of our 'source' cookie using either the console
or a cookie editor. If we change the value of the source cookie to be anything but 0, which is
the default value, then we get to see the source code for the login site.
There, we can see that we need to also create a cookie called 'getmein' and give it a random value.
Basically the site checks to see if your username is admin and your password is not admin. Then, the
following line checks to see if you can see the flag:

        if ($COOKIE["getmein"] === md5($secret . urldecode($username . $password)))

Basically what's going on is that the site is checking to see if the md5 hash of $secret + username + password
is equal to the value of the cookie 'getmein'. We can control the username and password, but we do not
know the value of $secret, which makes hard to decrypt. Additionally, the md5 will change based on your
password, so for this problem, we need to keep our password consistent.

Although we do not know the value of $secret, we DO know the value of an md5 hash encoded with $secret, which
is stored in the 'sample_hash' cookie. Knowing this, we can now perform a length extension attack.
This works because although we don't know the value of $secret, we do know the md5 hash of $secret + 'adminadmin', which
is what was appended to $secret during the encoding of our 'sample_hash' cookie.
Basically, if we know the md5 hash of md5(secret + known_text), we can find out the value of

        md5(secret + known_text + any_text)

Using hashpump, we can generate the md5 hash of the above, using

        hashpump -s 571580b26c65f306376d4f64e53cb5c7 -d adminadmin -k 15 -a test

where -s is the known md5 hash, -d is the known_text, -k is the length of $secret, and -a is any_text
In this case, I used 'test' as our any_text.
The resulting md5 hash is the value that must be put in 'getmein'.
The hex after that is the password, but you need to take away the first 'admin' from the beginning and perform 'urlencode' on it

The above example will output:

'getmein'   812eb16ab51abe511e93cd4cbec80641
            adminadmin\x80\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xc8\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00test
password:   admin%80%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%00%C8%00%00%00%00%00%00%00test
