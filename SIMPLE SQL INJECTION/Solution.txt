Viewing the source code of the server, we can see that it is indeed a very simple sql injection.
However, cannot just use ' OR 1=1 -- , since the server also checks the number of rows.
To bypass this, we simply add LIMIT 1 to the above injection, giving us

    ' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1 --

Putting this in the username field will give us the flag.
