Running the executable will tell us that our time has not come yet. However if we
turn off our network connection and run the executable, it tells us a different message, which is
that we have missed our opportunity (This was figured out because my laptop just loses connection
spontaneously). Then, if we spam parameters, or inputs, we are brought to another message, which
is that we need to use the force. Many linux commands have a -f option, which denotes force,
so if we add -f, we get the flag in a nice file.

    ./problem.linux.XD -f 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 (with wifi or ethernet disabled)
