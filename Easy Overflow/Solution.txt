We can change the value of secret by overflowing the password. Since the password length is 30 characters,
if we send in 31 characters, that 31st character would be the value of secret.

    python -c 'print "a"*30 + "C"' | nc stuyctf.me 12345

This overflows the 30 character name buffer, and adds 'C', which is the character that has the ascii value
of 67, which is the value that secret needs to be.
