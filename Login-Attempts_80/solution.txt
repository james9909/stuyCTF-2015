Playing around with the server a little bit, we find this:

    Attempt 1 of 3.
    Username: 1+1

We can view all the locals with the function locals(). Looking through a bit, we find the variable 'otp', which
contains a different string each time we connect to the server. Send the value of otp as the password and
get the flag.
