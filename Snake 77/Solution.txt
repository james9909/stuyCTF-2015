Upon viewing the hex for the image, we see a bunch of 7z's, and it looks like the
picture is actually hiding a bunch of compressed files. So, if we extract them,
we get the cipher, and key, which are used to decrypt the flag. Some searching shows
that there is a cipher called the serpent cipher, and we can decode the flag using the
cipher and key. The key is in base 64, so if we decode that, we get "What is Nicki Minaj's favorite song that refers to snakes?"
If we use the cipher, and 'anaconda' in the serpent cipher decoder, then we get the flag.
