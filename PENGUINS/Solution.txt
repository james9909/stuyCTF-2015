The image looks corrupted, so let's look for the original. By using Google's search
by image function, we can find an image that looks exactly like the corrupted one and
has the same resolution. Then, we can compare the bytes, using:

    'cmp -bl penguinActual.jpg penguin.jpg'

and we see that there is almost a flag, but it's incomplete.
If we open up a hex editor, or look at the results from hexdump, we can see that
there is the final part to the flag at the end of the hex, after 'ff d9' which
denotes the end of the picture. The characters from the byte comparison and the final
characters make up the flag.
