The hint tells us that we should look at what kind of file it is, so if we use a hex editor
like bless, we can determine that it is supposed to be a jpg file, since the beginning and end
of the files are similar. However, they are swapped, so we need to reverse all the bytes in the file.
Somehow, by pressing random buttons the bytes swapped, and when I saved it and viewed it, I got the flag.
